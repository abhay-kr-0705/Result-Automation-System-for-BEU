## Technical Details

### Web Scraping Process
1. Initialize Chrome WebDriver with headless mode
2. Navigate to BEU results homepage
3. Extract available B.Tech result links
4. For each selected semester:
   - Navigate to semester results page
   - Search for each registration number
   - Extract student data (name, marks, grades, SGPA, CGPA)
   - Handle errors for non-existent students
5. Compile all results into structured format
6. Export to Excel/CSV with proper formatting

### Data Structure
Each student result contains:
- Registration Number
- Student Name
- Semester and Year
- Subject-wise marks and grades
- SGPA/CGPA (if available)
- Overall result (PASS/FAIL)
- Error information (if any)

### Error Handling
- Graceful handling of non-existent registration numbers
- Network timeout and retry mechanisms
- WebDriver cleanup on completion or failure
- Detailed error reporting in output files

## Security Features

- Single account authentication
- Session management
- Secure file handling
- Input validation and sanitization

## Browser Compatibility

- Chrome WebDriver (automatically managed)
- Headless operation for server environments
- Responsive web interface for all modern browsers

   - Ensure Chrome browser is installed on the system

2. **Network Connectivity**
   - Verify internet connection
   - Check if BEU results website is accessible

3. **No Results Found**
   - Verify registration number format
   - Check if results are published for the selected semester/year
   - Ensure correct branch code selection

4. **Permission Errors**
